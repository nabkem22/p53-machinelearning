# p53-machinelearning
Deep Learning Model on p53 using Python, Keras, Tensorflow to predict the Conformational Substate Selection of p53 using energetics data from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.
Use file '1tup_wtandy220c218-223.csv' as the input data file to train model
Model predicts with 98-99% accuracy the Conformational Substate Selection of p53, specifically whether or not the Residues 218-223 of p53 contain a y220c 
cancer causing Mutation.
